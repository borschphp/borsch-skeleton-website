# Web servers

Borsch uses the front-controller pattern to funnel HTTP requests received by your web server
to a single PHP file: `./public/index.php`.

## PHP Built-in server

> **CAUTION**

> Warning: It is not intended to be a full-featured web server. It should not be used for production.
{style="warning"}

Run the following command in terminal to start a localhost web server:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t ./public/ ./public/index.php
# Or via composer script
composer serve
```

## Apache

Make sure the server root points to `./public/index.php`, then make sure a `.htaccess` file
exists in the same folder.  
By default there is one but if you deleted it then you can recreate one with this inside :

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
```

Make sure to enable Apache's mod_rewrite module and your virtual host is configured with the
`AllowOverride` option so that the `.htaccess` rewrite rules can be used:

```apache
AllowOverride All
```

## Nginx

Here is a basic virtual host configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    # If your app use SSL, and it should, comment the line above and configure the one below
    # listen 443 ssl;
    # ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/certificate.bundle.crt;
    # ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/certificate.key;

    # Replace with your values
    server_name borsch-app.domain.tld;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/borsch_access_log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/borsch_error_log;

    # Indicate your project path
    root /var/www/html/borsch/public;

    index index.php;

    # To modify according to your needs
    add_header X-Frame-Options "ALLOWALL";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "*";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "*";

    location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    location / {
             try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
}
```

## FrankenPHP

A `Dockerfile` is present at the root of your application, it can be used to start the application
with the worker mode for more performances.

Unlike other web server, with FrankenPHP in worker mode, the entrypoint of your application is the
file `./index/worker.php`.

## Other web servers

If you have configuration for other web server then let us know so we can add it here
(with a big thank you and a link to your page ðŸ˜‰).
